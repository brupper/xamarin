    Hack for handling partialview:
    @section Scripts {} in viewcomponents is ignored and not rendered by Asp.Net rendering engine.
    So just use at the end of the view component. Also if your jquery scripts are at specified at the end in your layout, then
    jquery will not be available in your viewcomponents. Of course moving the jquery script to the head section in layout will
    solve the problem but it is recommended to load the js files at the end.
    So if you want to keep jquery scripts at the end of layout and still use jquery in viewcomponents, you could use javascript
    domcontentloaded and any jquery can be written inside domcontentloaded. Not a permanent good approach but works for me.

<script>
    (function() {

        function setup() {
            showNotification(@Html.Raw((TempData.GetAsString(AjaxNotifcationModel.Key))));
        }

        // In case the document has finished parsing, document's readyState will be one of "complete", "interactive" or (non-standard) "loaded".
        if (/complete|interactive|loaded/.test(document.readyState)) { setup(); }
        // The document is not ready yet, so wait for the DOMContentLoaded event
        else { document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(event) { setup(); }, false); }
    })();
</script>
